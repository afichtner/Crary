    "# Crary waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Crary waves are a special type of elasto-acoustic waves in solid plates overlying a fluid half space. They have first been observed by Albert Paddock Crary, while he was stationed on ice island T-3, also known as Fletcher's Island, between 1952 and 1955. The first comprehensive theoretical analysis of these waves, which predates their actual observation, was by Frank Press and Maurice Ewing (*Propagation of elastic waves in a floating ice sheet*, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union, 32, 673-678, 1951). In the notebook below, we will largely follow their developments, adding some numerical calculations that were not possible back then."

    "## 1.1. Geometric setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a solid plate overlying a fluid half space. The $z-$axis is vertical and points downwards. The surface is located at $z=-H$, and the solid-fluid interface is at $z=H$. Both the solid and the fluid are homogeneous and isotropic. The solid has P-wave speed $\\alpha_1$ and S-wave speed $\\beta_1$. The P-wave speed of the fluid is $\\alpha_2$. Waves are assumed to be plane waves travelling in $x-$direction, which implies that the displacement field is constant in $y-$direction. (All $y-$derivatives vanish.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Displacement potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The system has non-trivial solutions for the amplitude coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ only when the determinant of the system matrix vanishes, that is, when $k$ (or $c$) is chosen such that $\\det{\\mathbf{M}}=0$ for a fixed circular frequency $\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trivial and uninteresting solutions**: This condition is satisfied in the special cases $c=\\alpha_1$ and $c=\\beta_1$ for all choices of $\\omega$. One can see this rather easily because these cases lead to $\\xi=0$ and $\\eta=0$, respectively, which then produces two identical columns in $\\mathbf{M}$. The resulting displacement fields, however, are not interesting. In fact, we find $C=-D$ for $c=\\beta_1$, which implies that the amplitude of the displacement field vanishes. Similarly, for $c=\\alpha_1$ we find $A=-B$, and the resulting displacement field vanishes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stoneley waves**: These are waves that are confined to the fluid-solid interface, with very small displacement at the surface. Stoneley waves have a phase velocity of approximately $0.87 \\alpha_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexural waves**: At low frequencies, the ice sheet deforms in the form of flexural waves with a phase velocity of approximately $2\\beta_1 \\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2/\\alpha_1^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rayleigh waves**: At high frequencies, the ice sheet effectively behaves like an infinite half space. The consequence are single-mode, non-dispersive Rayleigh waves with a phase velocity of around $0.92\\beta_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crary resonance**: Critical reflection of SV waves for SV-P conversion at the fluid-solid interface leads to resonance within a narrow frequency band around $\\beta_1/[2H\\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2/\\alpha_1^2}]$ Hz. The phase velocity of Crary resonance waves is the P-wave speed of the ice layer, $\\alpha_1$. Crary resonance was first observed and correctly interpreted by Crary (1954)."

    "\n",
    "To compute group velocity dispersion curves, we repeat the calculation above. The only difference is that we consider frequencies $\\omega+\\delta\\omega$, which leads to wave numbers $k+\\delta k$. Then we approximate the phase velocities as $c_g \\approx \\delta\\omega/\\delta k$. This finite-difference approach is rather crude, and it suffers to some extent from floating-point inaccuracies. Regardless of this issue, one needs to ensure that the phase velocities have been found with sufficient accuracy. In case the group velocity dispersion looks strange, the value of dc should probably be decreased."
